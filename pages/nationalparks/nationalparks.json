One hundred years ago, the mine was in full swing and this area was a hive of activity. On the left side of this view, behind the tailing piles, lies the Kennicott Glacier, and above it all, on the distant skyline, looms the blindingly-white, snow-covered Mt. Blackburn -- at 16,390 feet the third-highest peak in the park.",

Beyond the glacier and its meltwater lake lie the town of McCarthy and the vast expanse of the Chitina river valley. The scene changes throughout the day depending on weather and lighting: watch for dramatic summer cumulus clouds building over the mountains, rain squalls moving across the valley, windstorms blowing glacial loess off the river bars, and sunlight glinting off bare ice faces on the glacier.",

The eyrie produced two chicks that successfully fledged (permanently left the eyrie) the first week of August, before migrating south for the winter. Since the chicks fledged, winter's icy grasp on the Yukon River landscape has come and gone. Normally, you could enjoy a rare, beautiful view from high above the Yukon River, but this spring's break-up pushed ice high onto the shoreline, destroying the site of the data repeater. The repeater was an essential link for transmitting the image at the nest to the rest of the world. When the ice retreats, we will attempt to reestablish this vital link. For now, please enjoy the photos below of last year's peregrine nestlings in the eyrie. Webcam is currently inactive.",

In 2017, park staff installed a camera to monitor this source lake to better understand the dynamics of this cycle and reoccurring event. This camera provides a daily image that allows Kenai Fjords National Park researchers to monitor the behavior of this lake and, by analyzing the photos, we are working to better understand the timing and frequency of the drainage events that lead to flooding in the proglacial lake at Bear Glacier's terminus. This camera was purchased with NPS recreational fee funds and is maintained and monitored by Kenai Fjords National Park. Updated 09/02/2020",

      "description": "Yellowstone is a place of change, and this view highlights a place where change is constant and evident—the travertine terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs. Terraces form when water rises through limestone, which then allows the water to carry high amounts of dissolved calcium carbonate. At the surface, carbon dioxide is released and the calcium carbonate is deposited, forming travertine, the chalky white rock of the terraces. In the foreground are the parade grounds for historic Fort Yellowstone—the focal point of daily life at the fort. Each day began early with a bugler sounding Reveille. Another bugle call brought horse-mounted soldiers trotting onto the field for the flag-raising. Assignments were then announced. Troops either headed out to patrol the Mammoth Hot Spring Terraces and other nearby attractions, or remained at the fort to care for the horses. At dusk, the bugler called all troopers back to the grounds for the lowering of the flag, and the day was concluded with a cannon firing from the top of Capitol Hill. Taps was played as lights winked out and quiet settled over the fort.",

      "description": "Old Faithful, named by members of the 1870 Washburn Expedition, was once called “Eternity’s Timepiece” because of the regularity of its eruptions. Despite the myth, this geyser has never erupted at exact hourly intervals, nor is it the largest or most regular geyser in Yellowstone. It does, however, erupt more frequently than any other of the large geysers. This view of the Old Faithful Geyser is captured from a webcam inside the visitor education center. At this location, time is not measured by a clock, but by this geyser. Visitors make decisions on when to eat, take a tour, interact with exhibits, or watch the visitor center film based on Old Faithful's next eruption.",

However, it is not broadcasting a clear picture at all. Our staff is not sure if this is a problem with the camera itself, the transmitter, or receiver, but it is certain that one or more of these units is malfunctioning. At this point in the nesting season, there is no opportunity to troubleshoot without negatively impacting the breeding eagle pair who are already sitting on at least one egg. Therefore, there will be no broadcast of Shiloh's eagle nest camera this year.",

      "description": "The Bald Eagle Webcams provide an intimate view of the breeding and nesting behavior of bald eagles at the Channel Islands. In spring 2006, the first chick to hatch unaided by humans on the Channel Islands in over 50 years made headlines across the country. Thrilled with the public interest in this historic event, the National Park Service and its partners established webcams that bring live, streaming images of bald eagle nests into the schools and homes of millions of Americans.",

      "description": "There isn't a view much better than this. Swiftcurrent Lake provides the perfect setting to the mountains that loom in the distance. Dominating the view is Grinnell Point with Mount Gould to the left and Swiftcurrent Mountain to the right. In between Grinnell Point and Mt. Gould is the cirque where Grinnell Glacier lies. One of the most popular hikes in the park is the trek to Grinnell Glacier. That trail typically opens in mid-July. Opening sooner are the hikes to Red Rock Falls, Iceberg Lake, Apikuni Falls, and Cracker Lake. Many Glacier is a hiker's paradise.",

      "description": "This view to the southeast of Apgar Lookout shows part of the valley formed by the Middle Fork of the Flathead River. The valley offers a different, but still spectacular, contrast to the Going-to-the-Sun Road, inside the park. This section of the park offers some of the most challenging and remote experiences Glacier has to offer. The highlight of this view is the dramatic glacier-carved horn of Mount Saint Nicholas (elev. 9376 ft.). Does it remind you of any other peak? How about the Matterhorn in the European Alps? Both formed in the same way. When glaciers carve on three or more sides of a peak at the same time they form these classic glacial horns. We have several other horns in the park but no better representation than Saint Nicholas.",

If you are familiar with the road, look about one third up from the bottom just to the right of the middle of the view. That's approximately where Jackson Glacier Overlook is.
